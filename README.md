### 3. System Architecture

#### 3.1 Frontend
- React.js for the user interface.
- Use a state management library (e.g., Redux) for managing application state.
- Consider using a responsive design framework (e.g., Bootstrap) for UI responsiveness.

#### 3.2 Backend
- Node.js with Express.js for the server.
- MongoDB for data storage.
- JWT for user authentication.
- WebSocket for real-time updates.

#### 3.3 Local Device Integration
- Use a compatible local printer for receipt printing.
- Ensure the application is accessible on the local network.

### 4. User Roles
